    <h2>Work</h2>

    <p>I have been working in the bike industry since 2018 when i got hired at my local bike shop, Gregg's Greenlake Cycles, as a bike sales associate</p>
    <p>When the pandemic hit, I was asked to assist with our online sales department, as it had been rapidly expanding beyond the capabilities of one person, who had been previously running it. During this time I helped proccess, pick, and ship upwards of 100 order per day.</p>
    <p>As restrictions lifted, and the shop gained more foot traffic, I transitioned to the service department, where I assembled and repaired bikes</p>
    <p>Today, I have just started work at Fairhaven Bicycles as a sales associate and assistant service tech.</p>
