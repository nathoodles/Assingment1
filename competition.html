    <h2>Competition</h2>

    <p>Since I started mountain biking I have participated in 2 seasons of the NW cup, a downhill race series with races across Washington and neighboring states.</p>
    <p>Downhill races involve a set, strictly downhill course(as the name implies) of 3-5 minutes. One rider is put on the course at a time and races against the clock, fastest time wins. A race will usually involve a 3 day event with two days of open practice for riders to get used to the course before race day on the final day.</p>
    <p>Placing well at one race will give you points, and the rider with the most points at the end of a season, wins the series.</p>
