    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My Name is Nathaniel Keogh and I have chosen to write about mountain biking as it is something that has been central to me over the past few years.</p>
    <p>I started mountain biking sophomore year of high school when a friend of mine invited me out to our local bike park "Duthie Hill", which featured a whole range of jumps for both beginners and experienced riders</p>
    <p>I quickly became hooked, buying my own mountain bike and immersing myself in the culture surrounding the sport.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have started <a href="work.html">working in the bike industry</a> and <a href="competition.html">competing in local races</a>.</p>
